Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989,[9] it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and all releases of Apple's macOS prior to macOS Catalina.[10] A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.[11] It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.[12]

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions.

The shell's name is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces[13] and the notion of being "born again".[14][15]

A security hole in Bash dating from version 1.03 (August 1989),[16] dubbed Shellshock, was discovered in early September 2014 and quickly led to a range of attacks across the Internet.[17][18][19] Patches to fix the bugs were made available soon after the bugs were identified.

Brian Fox began coding Bash on January 10, 1988,[20] after Richard Stallman became dissatisfied with the lack of progress being made by a prior developer.[7] Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) considered a free shell that could run existing shell scripts so strategic to a completely free system built from BSD and GNU code that this was one of the few projects they funded themselves, with Fox undertaking the work as an employee of FSF.[7][21] Fox released Bash as a beta, version .99, on June 8, 1989,[9] and remained the primary maintainer until sometime between mid-1992[22] and mid-1994,[23] when he was laid off from FSF[24] and his responsibility was transitioned to another early contributor, Chet Ramey.[25][26][27]

Since then, Bash has become by far the most popular shell among users of Linux, becoming the default interactive shell on that operating system's various distributions[28][29] (although Almquist shell may be the default scripting shell) and on Apple's macOS releases before Catalina in October 2019.[30][31][10] Bash has also been ported to Microsoft Windows and distributed with Cygwin and MinGW, to DOS by the DJGPP project, to Novell NetWare, to OpenVMS by the GNV project,[32] to ArcaOS,[33] and to Android via various terminal emulation applications.

In September 2014, St√©phane Chazelas, a Unix/Linux specialist,[34] discovered a security bug in the program. The bug, first disclosed on September 24, was named Shellshock and assigned the numbers CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-7169. The bug was regarded as severe, since CGI scripts using Bash could be vulnerable, enabling arbitrary code execution. The bug was related to how Bash passes function definitions to subshells through environment variables.[
